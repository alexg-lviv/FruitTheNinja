<img src="icon.PNG" width=70 align="left"> **Fruit the Ninja** is a _2D action top-down arcade game_ written during the 48 hours GMTK Game Jam 2023. The jam main theme to implement was **Roles Reversed**, so the main concept of the game was to _reverse_ the gameplay of the famous game. Now the ninja doesn't slash the fruits, but the fruits slash the ninja!

Play the fast-paced rounds of crazy fruit assassination. Throw the most terrifying and dangerously exploding fruits directly into the ninja's head! Distract the stupid ninja with innocent apple, stun him with a heavy coconut, surprise him with an unexpected back attack with banana boomerang, play dangerous ping-pong with a bouncy watermelon, and finish him with the deadly pineapple missile launched right into his arse!

### Slow-motion

There are many types of dangerous fruits in the game, but they all would be futile if not the amazing **slow-motion mode**, designed specifically for beating the crap out of ninja. During this process, hit him as many times as you could, farming enormous amount of points! However, don't forget that it is a _limited resource_, which charges over time. Plan your attacks carefully!

### ~~Weapons~~ Fruits!

Please, be extremely careful with those bad boys:

- [x] **Dumb Apple** ![](assets/fruits/Apple.png) : The innocent, so fresh and young apple. It does not know it will be your main distraction
- [x] **Boomerang Banana** ![](assets/fruits/Banana.png) : As simple as it looks, the ninja can easily avoid the banana launch, yet he won't expect the tricky back attack!
- [x] **Atomic Cherry** ![](assets/fruits/Cherry.png) : A bombastic bomb that will tear the ninja apart
- [x] **Stunning Coconut** ![](assets/fruits/Coconut.png) : Launch this heavy bro directly into the head and use the ninja's concussion for your combo attacks!
- [x] **Shrapnel Grapes** ![](assets/fruits/Grape.png) : Though they may look small to you, the tiny projectiles can effectively hit the fat ninja and farm you tons of combos
- [x] **Bouncy Watermelon** ![](assets/fruits/Watermelon.png) : Use this based fruit as a ricochet to hit the ninja many times from unexpected angles
- [x] **Missile Pineapple** ![](assets/fruits/Pineapple.png) : Extremely dangerous stuff! Launch it carefully to wipe everything on its way from the existence!
